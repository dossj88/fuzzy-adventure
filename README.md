## Description

I was motivated to do this project to see where I am at with using node js and Object-Oriented Programming. I built this html team generator to quickly be able to update and build teams as needed. During this project I learned how to bet use npm such as inquirer and jest. I hope to learn how to use these tools more, so that I can apply them to my work in the future. 

## Usage

To use this team html generator you must use node index.js in your integrated terminal. You will them be prompted through the steps to make this html.
